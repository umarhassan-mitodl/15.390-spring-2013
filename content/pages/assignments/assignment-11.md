Assignment 11: Take an Entrepreneur to Dinner
---------------------------------------------

This assignment has several purposes. We want you to start to learn what it takes to be an entrepreneur.

*   What makes an entrepreneur tick?
*   How did this person come up with the idea behind his or her business?
*   What was this person's background?
*   Do you think you would want to start your own company?

We also want you to learn to network better, which is a big determinant of your success (or failure) as a businessperson. If you can't find an entrepreneur, call one of the portfolio companies of a successful VC firm in the Boston area. Some good VCs:

*   Atlas Venture
*   Battery Ventures
*   Bessemer Venture Partners
*   Charles River Ventures
*   Flagship Ventures
*   Flybridge Ventures
*   Greylock Highland Capital
*   Matrix Partners
*   Polaris Ventures
*   And there are others â€¦

We do not want you to interview VCs; we want you to interview individuals who have started companies (extra credit if you can find a failure who can articulate why he/she failed).

The deliverable for the assignment is a 2-page double-spaced memo. The content of the memo should answer a few or all of the questions listed above. Remember that this is an individual, not a team, assignment!
